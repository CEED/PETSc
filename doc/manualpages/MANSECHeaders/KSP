# Linear Solvers and Krylov Methods (KSP)

The `KSP` class provides an easy-to-use interface to the combination of
a Krylov subspace iterative method and a preconditioner `PC` for the solution of linear systems and some least squares problems. See
`PETSCREGRESSORLINEAR` for additional regression (least squares) solvers.
