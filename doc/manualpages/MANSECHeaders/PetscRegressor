# Regression Analysis and Classification (PetscRegressor)

The Regression Analysis and Classification (`PetscRegressor`) component provides a simple interface for supervised
statistical (or machine) learning regression (prediction of continuous numerical values, including least squares with `PETSCREGRESSORLINEAR`) or classification (prediction
of discrete labels or categories) tasks.

`PetscRegressor` internally employs `Tao` (or `KSP` for a few, specialized cases) to solve the underlying numerical
optimization problems. `PetscRegressor` users can set `Tao` options or otherwise directly manipulate the underlying
`Tao` context, which can be accessed via `PetscRegressorGetTao()`. User guide chapter: [](ch_regressor).
